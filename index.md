# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. This is my first real attempt at creating a website with the help of github pages.
I am very grateful that there are so many free resources to learn new skills with lab.github.com
They are pretty fun and quick to use. I would recommend doing this to any new or current college student studying
Computer Science/ Computer Engineering, or to anyone with a genuine interest in learning new skills.
